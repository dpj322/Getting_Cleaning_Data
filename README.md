# Getting_Cleaning_Data
This repo is for the peer-graded project in the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data. It contains the following folders and ifles:

 - run_analysis.R: An R script which cleans the data and performs some analysis.
 - data_set.csv: The merged, tidy data set containing only the mean and standard deviation data.
 - data_set_2.csv: A new tidy data set based on the above data, but with additional processing to take the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 - CodeBook.md: The codebook with descriptions of all the data and the processing steps undergone to tidy the data.
